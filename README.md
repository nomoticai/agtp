# Agent Transfer Protocol (AGTP)

> A dedicated application-layer protocol for autonomous AI agent traffic.

## What Is AGTP?

HTTP was designed for humans. AI agents are not humans.

Agent-generated traffic is autonomous, high-frequency, intent-driven,
and stateful across sequences of related requests. HTTP carries no
native semantics to distinguish an agent booking a flight from a
human clicking a link. It provides no protocol-level mechanism for
agent identity, authority scope, or attribution. And it cannot be
evolved to fix this — its method registry is frozen, its
backward-compatibility constraints are decades deep, and
infrastructure-level traffic differentiation is architecturally
impossible within HTTP's design.

AGTP is the dedicated transport layer that AI agents need. It sits
above TLS and below any agent messaging protocol (MCP, ACP, A2A),
providing:

- **Agent-native intent methods** — QUERY, SUMMARIZE, BOOK, SCHEDULE,
  LEARN, DELEGATE, COLLABORATE, CONFIRM, ESCALATE, NOTIFY — and a
  growing extended vocabulary organized by category
- **Protocol-level agent identity** — Agent-ID, Principal-ID, and
  Authority-Scope on every request, with an optional cryptographic
  certificate extension for verified identity
- **Governance primitives** — ESCALATE as a first-class method,
  authority scope enforcement, delegation chain tracking, and
  attribution records
- **Infrastructure observability** — agent traffic is distinguishable
  from human traffic at the routing layer without application-layer
  parsing

AGTP does not replace MCP, ACP, or A2A. Those are messaging protocols —
they define what agents say. AGTP defines how agent traffic moves.

### Core Methods

| Method | Category | Intent |
|---|---|---|
| QUERY | Acquire | Semantic data retrieval |
| SUMMARIZE | Compute | Synthesize content |
| BOOK | Transact | Reserve a resource |
| SCHEDULE | Orchestrate | Plan future actions |
| LEARN | Compute | Update agent context |
| DELEGATE | Orchestrate | Transfer task to sub-agent |
| COLLABORATE | Orchestrate | Coordinate peer agents |
| CONFIRM | Transact | Attest to a prior action |
| ESCALATE | Orchestrate | Defer to human authority |
| NOTIFY | Communicate | Push information |

A three-tier method vocabulary extends beyond the core ten:
Tier 2 standard methods (FETCH, SEARCH, VALIDATE, TRANSFER,
MONITOR, RUN, and ~30 others) and Tier 3 industry profile methods
(healthcare, financial services, legal, infrastructure) are defined
in companion specifications.

### Three Problems AGTP Solves

**1. Undifferentiated agent traffic.** HTTP cannot distinguish agent
requests from human requests at the infrastructure layer. AGTP
provides a dedicated protocol environment — agent traffic is
identifiable at the routing layer without payload parsing.

**2. Semantic mismatch.** HTTP's GET/POST/PUT/DELETE vocabulary was
designed for resource manipulation, not purposeful action. AGTP's
intent-based methods express what an agent is trying to accomplish
at the protocol level.

**3. No protocol-level identity.** HTTP carries no native mechanism
for agent identity, authority scope, or attribution. AGTP embeds
Agent-ID, Principal-ID, and Authority-Scope on every request, with
an optional cryptographic Agent Certificate extension for verified
identity at the transport layer.

## Intellectual Property

The **core AGTP specification** — all base methods, header fields,
status codes, and IANA registrations defined in this document — is
open and royalty-free.

Certain **extensions** referenced in the specification — specifically
the Agent Certificate extension and the ACTIVATE method — may be
subject to pending patent applications by the author. The licensor
is prepared to grant a royalty-free license to implementers for any
patent claims covering these extensions, consistent with the IETF's
IPR framework under RFC 8179.
